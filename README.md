# Implementation of Anomaly Detection On GSM/LTE Core Network KPI's With Using Prophet

This code is an implementation of Facebook's **Prophet** on real GSM core network KPI's to detect pattern changes. Prophet is developed by Facebook Data Scientists in order to analysis **Time Series Data**. Forcasting, **Anomaly Detection**, and **Trend Changpoints** are the main features that can be implemented on real KPI data of LTE **Core Networks**. For further information follow the link:

In a network, because of some network anomalies, customer behaviour changes or some external outages, the trends of Key Performance Indicators may change. And in such conditions, detecting the trend changes automatically is a crucial issue to recover the stability of the network. 

Below is one of the outcome of the imlementation of Prophet to a real Core Network KPI.
